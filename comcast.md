## [COMCAST TELECOM CONSUMER COMPLAINTS](https://github.com/manishgupta-ind/comcast_telecom_complaints_python_ds)

**Introduction:** I worked on this project titled “Comcast Telecom Consumer Complaints” to fulfil mandatory criteria towards “**Data Science with Python**” module of my PGP course from Simplilearn. I did not create any machine learning model in this project. I performed data analysis in python using various tools such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Worldcloud.

**Project Description:**

**Analysis Task:** To perform these tasks, you can use any of the different Python libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and BeautifulSoup.
-	Import data into Python environment.
-	Provide the trend chart for the number of complaints at monthly and daily granularity levels.
-	Provide a table with the frequency of complaint types.
•	Which complaint types are maximum i.e., around internet, network issues, or across any other domains.
- Create a new categorical variable with value as Open and Closed. Open & Pending is to be categorized as Open and Closed & Solved is to be categorized as Closed.
- Provide state wise status of complaints in a stacked bar chart. Use the categorized variable from Q3. Provide insights on:
•	Which state has the maximum complaints
