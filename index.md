<img src="images/Retail PGP0.png?raw=true"/>

**Introduction:** Customer segmentation is the practice of segregating the customer base into groups of individuals based on some common characteristics such as age, gender, interests, and spending habits. It is a way for organizations to understand their customers. Knowing the differences between customer groups, it’s easier to make strategic decisions regarding business growth and marketing campaigns. Implementing customer segmentation leads to plenty of new business opportunities and business can do a lot of optimization in budgeting, product design, promotion, marketing, customer satisfaction etc. The opportunities to segment are endless and depend mainly on how much customer data you have at your use. There are many machine learning algorithms, each suitable for a specific type of problem. One very common machine learning algorithm that’s suitable for customer segmentation problems is the k-means clustering algorithm which I have used for this project. There are other clustering algorithms as well such as DBSCAN, Agglomerative Clustering, and BIRCH, etc. 

**Objective:** This is my second capstone project and was part of the final assessment for PGP in Data Science course from Simplilearn-Purdue University. My job was to analyze transactional data for an online UK-based retail company and create customer segmentation so that company can create effective marketing campaign. This is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions that occurred between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011. The company mainly sells unique and all-occasion gifts.

### [Project No. 1: TEXT GENERATION USING DEEP LEARNING](https://github.com/manishgupta-ind/Text-Generation-using-Deep-Learning-RNN-)

<img src="images/RNN-1.jpg?raw=true"/>

**Introduction:** Deep Learning is the most exciting part of Data Science and the next stage after learning Machine Learning. I have worked on this project titled “Text Generation Using Deep Learning” to apply my **Deep Learning** for solving a major problem in **Natural Language Processing** known as **Language Modeling**. I used Keras library to create Recurrent Neural Network model and train it with our dataset to predict text for headline. 

**Objective:** Language Modelling is the core problem for a number of of natural language processing tasks such as speech to text, conversational system, and text summarization. A trained language model learns the likelihood of occurrence of a word/ character based on the previous sequence of words/ characters used in the text. Language models can be operated at character level, n-gram level, sentence level or even paragraph level. We will create a language model for predicting next word by implementing and training state-of-the-art Recurrent Neural Networks under Deep Learning.

**Tools used:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, NLP, Deep Learning, Tensorflow Keras, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTM).

**Introduction:** I worked on this project titled “Retail Analysis with Walmart Data” to fulfil mandatory criteria towards “**Data Science with R**” module of my PGP course from Simplilearn. I have created Linear Regression model using R programming language in this project. I performed hypothesis testing and statistical analysis in R using various libraries in R.

<img src="images/walmart.jpg?raw=true"/>

**Objective:** Walmart is one of the leading retail stores in the US. The business was facing a challenge due to unforeseen demands and would run out of stock sometimes. My task was to predict the sales and demand accurately. There are certain events and holidays which impact sales on each day. The sales data is available for 45 stores of Walmart. Walmart runs several promotional markdown events throughout the year. These markdowns precede prominent holidays, the four largest of all, which are the Super Bowl, Labour Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. The weeks including these holidays are weighted five times higher in the evaluation than non-holiday weeks. Part of the challenge faced in this project was modelling the effects of markdowns on these holiday weeks in the absence of complete/ideal historical data. My Machine Learning algorithm will predict demand accurately and ingest factors like economic conditions including CPI, Unemployment Index, etc.

**Tools used:** R programming language, dplyr, tidyr.
