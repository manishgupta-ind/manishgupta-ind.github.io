### Replicating Research: 

### [Project No. 1: Stock Trade Data Analysis](https://github.com/manishgupta-ind/trade_data_analysis)

<img src="images/stock_market.jpg?raw=true"/>

Objective: I was given a dataset (570 rows × 6 columns) containing historical trade details such as entry price, exit price, p&l and some technical indicators like atr_perc, roc and rsi. Objective was to analyze dataset in python and  try to find best range of atr_perc , roc , rsi  so that the sum of P&L is maximized for the range of values for atr_perc , roc , rsi.

Solution:

Indicator	Min. Value	Max. Value
RSI 		58.02 		89.72
ATR_perc	0.274223035    	0.427709112
ROC		-77.72927145 	2633.788326

Final P&L if we take entry only when given technical indicators were within above range: Rs. 65773

Time taken by program to process complete data and generate output: 2.03 seconds
